# BasicCalc
Ongoing, building out a command line calculator.

Supports the operators +, -, *, /, and ^. (Additional operators are planned to be added.)

The carot "^" operator must be surrounded by quotes in the command line.

Spaces must be between all operands and operators. Future ToDo - Parse if there are spaces or not.

Calculator does not support order of operations. Future ToDo - support order of operations and parenthesis.
